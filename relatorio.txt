Gene: INSL3

Title: INSL3 in the muscolo-skeletal system.

Abstract: Bone and skeletal muscle are currently considered a unified functional unit, showing complementary regulation at mechanical, biochemical, paracrine and metabolic levels. This functional unit undergoes a central hormonal regulation which is mainly ascribed to sex steroids and, in particular, androgens. However, recent evidence suggest that another testicular hormone lines the classical anabolic effect of testosterone on bone and muscle, the insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) acting on its specific receptor RXFP2. This minireview focuses on the most recent findings describing the role of INSL3/RXFP2 axis on the muscolo-skeletal system, from the mechanistic insights to the phenotypic consequences. Pathophysiological and therapeutic widenings deriving from available data are also discussed.

Title: Insulin-like factor 3, luteinizing hormone and testosterone in testicular cancer patients: effects of beta-hCG and cancer treatment.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Primary hypogonadism (low testosterone and high luteinizing hormone, LH) is present in approximately 20% of testicular cancer (TC) survivors after orchidectomy with or without chemotherapy. OBJECTIVES: We investigated insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3), a novel marker of Leydig cell function, in TC patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed: (I) a cross-sectional cohort of TC patients after orchidectomy with or without chemotherapy (1988-1999) at long-term follow-up (median 36 and 35 years of age at follow-up, respectively) and healthy men of similar age; (II) a longitudinal cohort of chemotherapy-treated TC patients (2000-2008), analyzed before and 1 year after chemotherapy (median 29 years of age at chemotherapy). INSL3, testosterone, and LH were compared between groups and over time and related to pre-chemotherapy beta-hCG levels. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional cohort, TC patients at median 7 years after orchidectomy and chemotherapy (n = 79) had higher LH (p < 0.001), lower testosterone (p = 0.001), but similar INSL3 as controls (n = 40). After orchidectomy only (n = 25), higher LH (p = 0.02), but no differences in testosterone or INSL3 were observed compared to controls. In the longitudinal cohort, patients with normal pre-chemotherapy beta-hCG (</=5 mU/L, n = 35) had increased LH 1 year after chemotherapy compared to pre-chemotherapy (p = 0.001), and no change in testosterone or INSL3. In contrast, patients with high beta-hCG pre-chemotherapy (n = 42) had suppressed LH, markedly elevated testosterone, and low INSL3 at start of chemotherapy, with increased LH, decreased testosterone, and increased INSL3 1 year later (all p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Changes in LH show that gonadal endocrine function is disturbed before chemotherapy, 1 year later, and at long-term follow-up in chemotherapy-treated TC patients. CONCLUSION: Pre-chemotherapy, beta-hCG-producing tumors affect the gonadal endocrine axis, demonstrated by increased testosterone and decreased LH. INSL3 did not uniformly follow the pattern of testosterone.

Gene: MED13L

Title: Mediator complex component MED13 regulates zygotic genome activation and is required for postimplantation development in the mouse.

Abstract: Understanding factors that regulate zygotic genome activation (ZGA) is critical for determining how cells are reprogrammed to become totipotent or pluripotent. There is limited information regarding how this process occurs physiologically in early mammalian embryos. Here, we identify a mediator complex subunit, MED13, as translated during mouse oocyte maturation and transcribed early from the zygotic genome. Knockdown and conditional knockout approaches demonstrate that MED13 is essential for ZGA in the mouse, in part by regulating expression of the embryo-specific chromatin remodeling complex, esBAF. The role of MED13 in ZGA is mediated in part by interactions with E2F transcription factors. In addition to MED13, its paralog, MED13L, is required for successful preimplantation embryo development. MED13L partially compensates for loss of MED13 function in preimplantation knockout embryos, but postimplantation development is not rescued by MED13L. Our data demonstrate an essential role for MED13 in supporting chromatin reprogramming and directed transcription of essential genes during ZGA.


Title: MED13L-related intellectual disability: involvement of missense variants and delineation of the phenotype.

Abstract: Molecular anomalies in MED13L, leading to haploinsufficiency, have been reported in patients with moderate to severe intellectual disability (ID) and distinct facial features, with or without congenital heart defects. Phenotype of the patients was referred to "MED13L haploinsufficiency syndrome." Missense variants in MED13L were already previously described to cause the MED13L-related syndrome, but only in a limited number of patients. Here we report 36 patients with MED13L molecular anomaly, recruited through an international collaboration between centers of expertise for developmental anomalies. All patients presented with intellectual disability and severe language impairment. Hypotonia, ataxia, and recognizable facial gestalt were frequent findings, but not congenital heart defects. We identified seven de novo missense variations, in addition to protein-truncating variants and intragenic deletions. Missense variants clustered in two mutation hot-spots, i.e., exons 15-17 and 25-31. We found that patients carrying missense mutations had more frequently epilepsy and showed a more severe phenotype. This study ascertains missense variations in MED13L as a cause for MED13L-related intellectual disability and improves the clinical delineation of the condition.

Gene: RET

Title: Consecutive bouts of electrical stimulation-induced contractions alter ribosome biogenesis in rat skeletal muscle.

Abstract: Ribosome biogenesis has been implicated in resistance exercise training (RET)-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy. However, it is unclear how increasing bouts of RET affects ribosome content and biogenesis. This was investigated in the present study using simulated RET where rat skeletal muscle is subjected to increasing bouts of electrical stimulations. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to the following seven groups: sedentary for 5 days (SED) or 6 weeks (SED_6w), resistance-exercise trained with 1 bout (1B), 2 bouts (2B), 3 bouts (3B), 6 bouts (6B), and 18 bouts (18B). RET was simulated on the right gastrocnemius muscle by transcutaneous electric stimulation under isoflurane anesthesia, and RET bout was given 3 times a week. Rats in 1B, 2B and 3B groups showed increased 45S precursor (pre-) rRNA and 18S+28S rRNA content per muscle weight and elevated mRNA levels of c-myc and upstream binding factor (UBF). Increases in phosphorylated UBF and total cyclin D1 protein level were observed 48 h after RET; the former increased as a function of RET duration. In 3B, 6B and 18B groups, the 18S+28S rRNA content per muscle weight was kept unchanged, and 45S pre-rRNA, cyclin D1 and phosphorylated UBF levels in 18B were lower than those in 3B. These results suggest that RET activates ribosome biogenesis and increases ribosome content through modulation of UBF and cyclin D1 activity at its early phase. Additional bouts of RET may not lead to further increase in ribosome content per muscle weight through possibly the attenuation of transcription process.

Title: Clinical impact of testing for mutations and microRNAs in thyroid nodules.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We report results of a multicenter clinical experience study examining the likelihood of patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules to undergo surgery or have malignant outcome based on multiplatform combination mutation and microRNA testing (MPT). METHODS: MPT assessed mutations in BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, and PIK3CA genes, PAX8/PPARgamma, RET/PTC1, and RET/PTC3 gene rearrangements, and the expression of 10 microRNAs. Baseline clinical information at the time of MPT and clinical follow-up records were reviewed for 337 patients, of which 80% had negative MPT results. Kaplan Meier analysis for cumulative probability of survival without having a surgical procedure or malignant diagnosis over the course of patient follow-up was determined for MPT results of 180 patients, among which only 14% had malignancy. RESULTS: A negative MPT result in nodules with Bethesda III or IV cytology (2009) conferred a high probability of non-surgical treatment, with only 11% expected to undergo surgery and a high probability of survival without malignancy (92%) for up to 2 years follow up. A positive MPT result conferred a 57% probability of malignancy and was an independent risk factor for undergoing surgical treatment (Hazard Ratio [HR] 9.2, 95% confidence intervals 5.4-15.9, P < .0001) and for malignancy (HR 13.4, 95% confidence intervals 4.8-37.2, P < .0001). For nodules with weak driver mutations, positive microRNA test results supported high risk of cancer while negative results downgraded cancer risk. CONCLUSION: MPT results are predictive of real-world decisions to surgically treat indeterminate thyroid nodules, with those decisions being appropriately aligned with a patient's risk of malignancy over time.

Gene: KCNQ1

Title: Teamwork: Ion channels and transporters join forces in the brain.

Abstract: Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels open in response to changes in membrane potential to permit passage of K(+) ions across the cell membrane, down their electrochemical gradient. Sodium-coupled solute transporters utilize the downhill sodium gradient to co-transport solutes, ranging from ions to sugars to neurotransmitters, into the cell. A variety of recent studies have uncovered cooperation between these two structurally and functionally unrelated classes of protein, revealing previously unnoticed functional crosstalk and in many cases physical interaction to form channel-transporter (chansporter) complexes. Adding to this field, Bartolome-Martin and colleagues now report that the heteromeric KCNQ2/KCNQ3 (Kv7.2/7.3) potassium channel - the primary molecular correlate of the neuronal M-current - can physically interact with two sodium-coupled neurotransmitter transporters expressed in the brain, DAT and GLT1 (dopamine and glutamate transporters, respectively). The authors provide evidence that the interactions may enhance transporter activity while dampening the depolarizing effects of sodium influx. Cumulative evidence discussed here suggests that chansporter complexes represent a widespread form of cellular signaling hub, in the CNS and other tissues.


Title: Involvement of sex hormonal regulation of K(+) channels in electrophysiological and contractile functions of muscle tissues.

Abstract: Sex hormones, such as testosterone, progesterone, and 17beta-estradiol, control various physiological functions. This review focuses on the sex hormonal regulation of K(+) channels and the effects of such regulation on electrophysiological and contractile functions of muscles. In the cardiac tissue, testosterone and progesterone shorten action potential, and estrogen lengthens QT interval, a marker of increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. We have shown that testosterone and progesterone in physiological concentration activate KCNQ1 channels via membrane-delimited sex hormone receptor/eNOS pathways to shorten the action potential duration. Mitochondrial K(+) channels are also involved in the protection of cardiac muscle. Testosterone and 17beta-estradiol directly activate mitochondrial inner membrane K(+) channels (Ca(2+) activated K(+) channel (KCa channel) and ATP-sensitive K(+) channel (KATP channel)) that are involved in ischemic preconditioning and cardiac protection. During pregnancy, uterine blood flow increases to support fetal growth and development. It has been reported that 17beta-estradiol directly activates large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel (BKCa channel) attenuating arterial contraction. Furthermore, 17beta-estradiol increases expression of BKCa channel beta1 subunit which enhances BKCa channel activity by DNA demethylation. These findings are useful for understanding the mechanisms of sex or generation-dependent differences in the physiological and pathological functions of muscles, and the mechanisms of drug actions.

Gene: FAN1

Title: FAN1 modifies Huntington's disease progression by stabilizing the expanded HTT CAG repeat.

Abstract: Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. CAG repeat length explains around half of the variation in age at onset (AAO) but genetic variation elsewhere in the genome accounts for a significant proportion of the remainder. Genome-wide association studies have identified a bidirectional signal on chromosome 15, likely underlain by FANCD2- and FANCI-associated nuclease 1 (FAN1), a nuclease involved in DNA interstrand cross link repair. Here we show that increased FAN1 expression is significantly associated with delayed AAO and slower progression of HD, suggesting FAN1 is protective in the context of an expanded HTT CAG repeat. FAN1 overexpression in human cells reduces CAG repeat expansion in exogenously expressed mutant HTT exon 1, and in patient-derived stem cells and differentiated medium spiny neurons, FAN1 knockdown increases CAG repeat expansion. The stabilizing effects are FAN1 concentration and CAG repeat length-dependent. We show that FAN1 binds to the expanded HTT CAG repeat DNA and its nuclease activity is not required for protection against CAG repeat expansion. These data shed new mechanistic insights into how the genetic modifiers of HD act to alter disease progression and show that FAN1 affects somatic expansion of the CAG repeat through a nuclease-independent mechanism. This provides new avenues for therapeutic interventions in HD and potentially other triplet repeat disorders.

Title: A clinical and genetic study of early-onset and familial parkinsonism in taiwan: An integrated approach combining gene dosage analysis and next-generation sequencing.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recent genetic progress has allowed for the molecular diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. However, genetic causes of PD vary widely in different ethnicities. Mutational frequencies and clinical phenotypes of genes associated with PD in Asian populations are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to identify the mutational frequencies and clinical spectrums of multiple PD-causative genes in a Taiwanese PD cohort. METHODS: A total of 571 participants including 324 patients with early-onset parkinsonism (onset age, <50 years) and 247 parkinsonism pedigrees were recruited at a tertiary referral center in Taiwan from 2002 to 2017. Genetic causes were identified by an integrated approach including gene dosage analysis, a targeted next-generation sequencing panel containing 40 known PD-causative genes, repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction, and whole-exome sequencing analysis. RESULTS: Thirty of the 324 patients with early-onset parkinsonism (9.3%) were found to carry mutations in Parkin, PINK1, or PLA2G6 or had increased trinucleotide repeats in SCA8. Twenty-nine of 109 probands with autosomal-recessive inheritance of parkinsonism (26.6%) were found to carry mutations in Parkin, PINK1, GBA, or HTRA2. The genetic causes for the 138 probands with an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern of parkinsonism were more heterogeneous. Seventeen probands (12.3%) carried pathogenic mutations in LRRK2, VPS35, MAPT, GBA, DNAJC13, C9orf72, SCA3, or SCA17. A novel missense mutation in the UQCRC1 gene was found in a family with autosomal-dominant inheritance parkinsonism via whole-exome sequencing analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a better understanding of the genetic architecture of PD in eastern Asia and broaden the clinical spectrum of PD-causing mutations. (c) 2019 The Authors.

Title: New Genes Causing Hereditary Parkinson's Disease or Parkinsonism.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews was to review genes where putative or confirmed pathogenic mutations causing Parkinson's disease or Parkinsonism have been identified since 2012, and summarizes the clinical and pathological picture of the associated disease subtypes. RECENT FINDINGS: Newly reported genes for dominant Parkinson's disease are DNAJC13, CHCHD2, and TMEM230. However, the evidence for a disease-causing role is not conclusive, and further genetic and functional studies are warranted. RIC3 mutations have been reported from one family but not yet encountered in other patients. New genes for autosomal recessive disease include SYNJ1, DNAJC6, VPS13C, and PTRHD1. Deletions of a region on chromosome 22 (22q11.2del) are also associated with early-onset PD, but the mode of inheritance and the underlying causative gene remain unclear. PODXL mutations were reported in autosomal recessive PD, but their roles remain to be confirmed. Mutations in RAB39B cause an X-linked Parkinsonian disorder. Mutations in the new dominant PD genes have generally been found in medium- to late-onset Parkinson's disease. Many mutations in the new recessive and X-chromosomal genes cause severe atypical juvenile Parkinsonism, but less devastating mutations in these genes may cause PD.

Gene: TTC7A

Title: Epithelial proliferation in inflammatory skin disease is regulated by tetratricopeptide repeat domain 7 (Ttc7) in fibroblasts and lymphocytes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mutations in tetratricopeptide repeat domain 7A (TTC7A) and its mouse orthologue, Ttc7, result in a multisystemic disease, mostly affecting the epithelial barriers and immune system. Despite successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, ongoing progression of gastrointestinal manifestations can be life-threatening in TTC7A-deficient patients. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify whether TTC7A mutations dysregulate epithelial cells only or whether a cell-intrinsic defect in lymphocytes or other cells contributes to disease manifestations. METHODS: Ttc7-mutated (Ttc7(fsn/fsn)) mice were crossed to generate double-mutant (Rag2(-/-)Ttc7(fsn/fsn)) and triple-mutant (Rag2(-/-)IL2rg(-/-)Ttc7(fsn/fsn)) mice. These models, together with bone marrow chimeras, were used to explore the role of adaptive and innate lymphocytes in the flaky skin phenotype. The effect of the Ttc7(fsn/fsn) mutation on stromal cells was tested in a xenograft model in conjunction with transcriptomic analysis of Ttc7(fsn/fsn) fibroblasts. RESULTS: We observed that the severity of epithelial hyperproliferation was accentuated by lymphocytes, whereas the phenotype was not induced by transfer of Ttc7-mutated hematopoietic cells. Furthermore, mice completely lacking the lymphocytic compartment were not protected from epithelial hyperproliferation. Ttc7-mutated mouse fibroblasts expressed increased transcript levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) and the antimicrobial protein regenerating islet-derived protein 3gamma (Reg3gamma). In a xenograft model Ttc7-mutated fibroblasts markedly increased epithelial proliferation of keratinocytes. Thus Ttc7-mutated fibroblasts were identified as potent instigators of epithelial hyperproliferation. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal a previously unsuspected fundamental cell-extrinsic role of Ttc7. We have identified potential candidates for molecularly targeted treatment strategies that will need to be evaluated in future preclinical studies.

Title: Congenital intestinal atresias with multiple episodes of sepsis: A case report and review of literature.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Hereditary multiple intestinal atresia associated with severe combined immunodeficiency (MIA-SCID) is a very rare disease caused by deleterious mutations in the tetratricopeptide repeat domain-containing protein 7A gene TTC7A. It is characterized by intestinal obstruction, sepsis, and a poor prognosis. Insights into phenotype-genotype correlations could help to guide genetic counseling and increase our knowledge of the natural history of this disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a newborn in which his fetal magnetic resonance imaging showed jejunal atresia and microcolon and an abdominal x-ray at birth confirmed intestinal obstruction. The clinical course was complicated by multiple episodes of sepsis, and laboratory investigations showed SCID. The genetic analysis identified a homozygous c.53344_53347 mutation in the TTC7A gene compatible with MIA-SCID syndrome. The patient required 3 operations because of new intestinal atresias in the first months of life. She underwent bone marrow transplantation at 8 months of age but died of liver failure secondary to graft-versus-host disease. CONCLUSION: Immunologic assessment and genetic screening for TTC7A mutations are important in patients with MIA. Greater knowledge of the functions of the TTC7A protein will have important therapeutic implications for patients with MIA-SCID syndrome.

Gene: DTNA

Title: Phenotype and Functional Analyses in a Transgenic Mouse Model of Left Ventricular Noncompaction Caused by a DTNA Mutation.

Abstract: DTNA encoding dystrobrevin-alpha (alpha-DB) is a putative causal gene associated with left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC). The aim of the study was to investigate the causal role of DTNA in LVNC using a transgenic mouse model.A missense mutation (c.146A > G, p.N49S) of DTNA was identified in a patient with LVNC by Sanger sequencing. Six independent lines of transgenic mice expressing the mutant DTNA under a myosin heavy chain 6 (Myh6) promoter were generated (Myh6:Dtna(N49S)). Phenotypic characteristics of DTNA-p.N49S mutations were evaluated by echocardiography, histological observation, and immunoblotting. Multiple trabeculation and a higher ratio of non-compacted to compact myocardial layer were found in the Myh6:Dtna(N49S) mice compared to the controls. The transgenic mice also showed left ventricular (LV) dilation and cardiac systolic dysfunction. In conclusion, overexpression of the DTNA-p.N49S mutation in a mouse heart can be responsible for the phenotype of deep trabeculation, dilated cardiomyopathy, and cardiac dysfunction, which resembles the phenotype of LVNC.

Title: Prenatal diagnosis and molecular cytogenetic characterization of an interstitial deletion of 18q12.1-q12.3 encompassing DTNA, CELF4 and SETBP1.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We present prenatal diagnosis and molecular cytogenetic characterization of an interstitial deletion of 18q12.1-q12.3. CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old woman underwent amniocentesis at 18 weeks of gestation because of advanced maternal age. Amniocentesis revealed a karyotype of 46,XX,del(18)(q12.1q12.3). The fetal ultrasound was unremarkable. The woman underwent repeat amniocentesis at 20 weeks of gestation. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) using uncultured amniocytes revealed a 10.76-Mb interstitial deletion 18q12.1-q12.3 or arr 18q12.1q12.3 (31,944,347-42,704,784) x 1.0 encompassing 19 Online Mendelian Inheritance of in Man (OMIM) genes including DTNA, CELF4 and SETBP1. Metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis on cultured amniocytes confirmed an 18q proximal interstitial deletion. The parental karyotypes were normal. Polymorphic DNA marker analysis determined a paternal origin of the deletion. The pregnancy was subsequently terminated at 24 weeks of gestation, and a 650-g fetus was delivered with characteristic facial dysmorphism. CONCLUSION: aCGH analysis and polymorphic DNA marker analysis at amniocentesis are useful for determination of the deleted genes and the parental origin of the de novo deletion, and the acquired information is helpful for genetic counseling.

Title: Electronic health record phenotype in subjects with genetic variants associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: a study of 30,716 subjects with exome sequencing.

Abstract: PurposeArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart disease. Clinical follow-up of incidental findings in ARVC-associated genes is recommended. We aimed to determine the prevalence of disease thus ascertained.MethodsIndividuals (n = 30,716) underwent exome sequencing. Variants in PKP2, DSG2, DSC2, DSP, JUP, TMEM43, or TGFbeta3 that were database-listed as pathogenic or likely pathogenic were identified and evidence-reviewed. For subjects with putative loss-of-function (pLOF) variants or variants of uncertain significance (VUS), electronic health records (EHR) were reviewed for ARVC diagnosis, diagnostic criteria, and International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes.ResultsEighteen subjects had pLOF variants; none of these had an EHR diagnosis of ARVC. Of 14 patients with an electrocardiogram, one had a minor diagnostic criterion; the rest were normal. A total of 184 subjects had VUS, none of whom had an ARVC diagnosis. The proportion of subjects with VUS with major (4%) or minor (13%) electrocardiogram diagnostic criteria did not differ from that of variant-negative controls. ICD-9 codes showed no difference in defibrillator use, electrophysiologic abnormalities or nonischemic cardiomyopathies in patients with pLOF or VUSs compared with controls.ConclusionpLOF variants in an unselected cohort were not associated with ARVC phenotypes based on EHR review. The negative predictive value of EHR review remains uncertain.

Title: TMEM43-S358L mutation enhances NF-kappaB-TGFbeta signal cascade in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is a genetic cardiac muscle disease that accounts for approximately 30% sudden cardiac death in young adults. The Ser358Leu mutation of transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43) was commonly identified in the patients of highly lethal and fully penetrant ARVD subtype, ARVD5. Here, we generated TMEM43 S358L mouse to explore the underlying mechanism. This mouse strain showed the classic pathologies of ARVD patients, including structural abnormalities and cardiac fibrofatty. TMEM43 S358L mutation led to hyper-activated nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in heart tissues and primary cardiomyocyte cells. Importantly, this hyper activation of NF-kappaB directly drove the expression of pro-fibrotic gene, transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta1), and enhanced downstream signal, indicating that TMEM43 S358L mutation up-regulates NF-kappaB-TGFbeta signal cascade during ARVD cardiac fibrosis. Our study partially reveals the regulatory mechanism of ARVD development.

Abstract: CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: KBG syndrome is typically characterized by macrodontia (especially of the upper central incisors), characteristic facial features (triangular face, brachycephaly, synophrys, widely spaced eyes, broad or bushy eyebrows, prominent ears, prominent nasal bridge, bulbous nose, anteverted nares, long philtrum, and thin vermilion of the upper lip), short stature, developmental delay / intellectual disability, and behavioral issues. Affected individuals may have feeding difficulties (particularly in infancy), skeletal anomalies (brachydactyly, large anterior fontanelle with delayed closure, scoliosis), hearing loss (conductive, mixed, and sensorineural), seizure disorder, and brain malformations. There is significant variability in the clinical findings, even between affected members of the same family. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of KBG syndrome is confirmed in a proband by detection of either a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ANKRD11 or deletion of 16q24.3 that includes ANKRD11. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations. Surgical corrections and/or speech therapy for palatal anomalies; nasogastric tube feeding in infants; pharmacologic treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease; pressure-equalizing tubes and/or tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy for chronic otitis media; consideration of amplification for hearing loss; consideration of growth hormone therapy for short stature and medication to arrest puberty for premature pubertal development; standard treatment of seizure disorder, undescended testis in males, congenital heart defects, strabismus / refractive errors, and developmental disabilities. Surveillance. Routine monitoring of hearing, vision, growth, pubertal status (in prepubertal individuals), and cognitive development. Agents/circumstances to avoid. Ototoxic drugs should be avoided because of the risk for hearing loss. Pregnancy management. Pregnancy management should be tailored to the specific features in the affected woman. For example, involvement of a cardiologist and maternal fetal medicine physician for a pregnant woman with a history of a congenital heart defect; control of seizures during pregnancy for those with a seizure disorder. GENETIC COUNSELING: Recurrence risk for sibs of a proband with KBG syndrome depends on the genetic alteration: Deletion of 16q24.3 (~75% of reported pathogenic variants are de novo and the remainder are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.) ANKRD11 sequence variants (~66% of reported pathogenic variants are de novo and the remainder are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.) Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible if the causative genetic alteration has been identified in an affected family member.

Title: Genotype and phenotype analysis using an epilepsy-associated gene panel in Chinese pediatric epilepsy patients.

Abstract: Epilepsy is a common and genetically heterogeneous disorder among children. Advances in next-generation sequencing have revealed that numerous epilepsy genes, helped us improve the understanding of mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis, and guided the development of treatments. We identified 39 candidate variants in 21 genes, including 37 that were pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics scoring system and two variants of uncertain significance that were considered causative after they were associated with clinical characteristics. Thirty were de novo variants (76.9%), and 20 variants had not previously been reported (51.3%). We obtained a diagnosis in 39 of the 141 probands (27.7%). The most frequently mutated gene was SCN1A; KCNQ2, KCNT1, PCDH19, STXBP1, SCN2A, TSC2, and PRRT2 were mutated in more than one individual; ANKRD11, CDKL5, DCX, DEPDC5, GABRB3, GRIN2A, IQSEC2, KCNA2, KCNB1, KCNJ6, TSC1, SCN9A, and SCN1B were mutated in a single individual. In addition, we detected a nonsense variant in a candidate gene KCND1 and considered it as a new candidate epilepsy gene, which needed further functional study. Consequently, large number of unreported variants were detected, diverse phenotypes were associated with known epilepsy genes. Changes in clinical management beyond genetic counseling were suggested.
