Title: Mutations in the mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase cause hyperuricemia, pulmonary hypertension, renal failure in infancy and alkalosis, HUPRA syndrome.
Abstract: An uncharacterized multisystemic mitochondrial cytopathy was diagnosed in two infants from consanguineous Palestinian kindred living in a single village. The most significant clinical findings were tubulopathy (hyperuricemia, metabolic alkalosis), pulmonary hypertension, and progressive renal failure in infancy (HUPRA syndrome). Analysis of the consanguineous pedigree suggested that the causative mutation is in the nuclear DNA. By using genome-wide SNP homozygosity analysis, we identified a homozygous identity-by-descent region on chromosome 19 and detected the pathogenic mutation c.1169A>G (p.Asp390Gly) in SARS2, encoding the mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase. The same homozygous mutation was later identified in a third infant with HUPRA syndrome. The carrier rate of this mutation among inhabitants of this Palestinian isolate was found to be 1:15. The mature enzyme catalyzes the ligation of serine to two mitochondrial tRNA isoacceptors: tRNA(Ser)(AGY) and tRNA(Ser)(UCN). Analysis of amino acylation of the two target tRNAs, extracted from immortalized peripheral lymphocytes derived from two patients, revealed that the p.Asp390Gly mutation significantly impacts on the acylation of tRNA(Ser)(AGY) but probably not that of tRNA(Ser)(UCN). Marked decrease in the expression of the nonacylated transcript and the complete absence of the acylated tRNA(Ser)(AGY) suggest that this mutation leads to significant loss of function and that the uncharged transcripts undergo degradation.

Title: Working your SOCS off: The role of ASB10 and protein degradation pathways in glaucoma.
Abstract: Evidence is accumulating to suggest that mutations in the Ankyrin and SOCS Box-containing protein-10 (ASB10) gene are associated with glaucoma. Since its identification in a large Oregon family with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), ASB10 variants have been associated with disease in US, German and Pakistani cohorts. ASB10 is a member of the ASB family of proteins, which have a common structure including a unique N-terminus, a variable number of central ankyrin (ANK) repeat domains and a suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) box at the C-terminus. Mutations in ASB10 are distributed throughout the entire length of the gene including the two alternatively spliced variants of exon 1. A homozygous mutation in a Pakistani individual with POAG, which lies in the center of the SOCS box, is associated with a particularly severe form of the disease. Like other SOCS box-containing proteins, ASB10 functions in ubiquitin-mediated degradation pathways. The ANK repeats bind to proteins destined for degradation. The SOCS box recruits ubiquitin ligase proteins to form a complex to transfer ubiquitin to a substrate bound to the ANK repeats. The ubiquitin-tagged protein then enters either the proteasomal degradation pathway or the autophagic-lysosomal pathway. The choice of pathway appears to be dependent on which lysine residues are used to build polyubiquitin chains. However, these reciprocal pathways work in tandem to degrade proteins because inhibition of one pathway increases degradation via the other pathway. In this publication, we will review the literature that supports identification of ASB10 as a glaucoma-associated gene and the current knowledge of the function of the ASB10 protein. In addition, we present new data that indicates ASB10 expression is up-regulated by the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1alpha. Finally, we will describe the emerging role of other SOCS box-containing proteins in protein degradation pathways in ocular cells.

Title: Epigenome-Wide Analyses Identify Two Novel Associations With Recurrent Stroke in the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention Clinical Trial.
Abstract: DNA methylation, a well-characterized epigenetic modification that is influenced by both environment and genetic variation, has previously been implicated in a number of complex diseases, including cardiovascular disease and stroke. The goal of this study was to evaluate epigenome-wide associations with recurrent stroke and the folate one-carbon metabolism-related trait, plasma homocysteine (hcy). Differential methylation analyses were performed on 473,864 autosomal CpG loci, using Illumina HumanMethylation 450K array data in 180 ischemic stroke cases from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) clinical trial. Linear regression was used to assess associations between number of strokes prior to VISP enrollment and measures of hcy with degree of methylation (beta-values), while logistic regression was used to evaluate recurrent stroke status and incident recurrent stroke associations. All regression analyses were stratified by race. Two differentially methylated CpG sites exceeded epigenome-wide significance (p </= 1.055 x 10(-7)) for prior number of strokes (PNS) in European Americans. The top locus, cg22812874, was located in the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 10 gene (ASB10; p = 3.4 x 10(-9); beta = -0.0308; 95% CI = -0.040, -0.002). Methylation locus cg00340919, located in an intron of the tetratricopeptide repeat domain 37 gene, was also statistically significant (TTC37; p = 8.74 x 10(-8); beta = -0.0517; 95% CI = -0.069, -0.034). An additional 138 CpG sites met our threshold for suggestive significance (p </= 5 x 10(-5)). We evaluated DNA methylation associated with recurrent stroke and hcy phenotypes across the epigenome. Hypermethylation at two CpG sites located in ASB10 and TTC37 was associated with fewer strokes prior to VISP enrollment. Our findings present a foundation for additional epigenome-wide studies, as well as mechanistic studies into epigenetic marks that influence recurrent stroke risk.

Title: Outcome of Frail Do-Not-Intubate Subjects With End-Stage Chronic Respiratory Failure and Their Opinion of Noninvasive Ventilation to Reverse Hypercapnic Coma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in the emergency setting to reverse hypercapnic coma in frail patients with end-stage chronic respiratory failure and do-not-intubate orders remains a questionable issue given the poor outcome of this vulnerable population. We aimed to answer this issue by assessing not only subjects' outcome with NIV but also subjects' point of view regarding NIV for this indication. METHODS: A prospective observational case-control study was conducted in 3 French tertiary care hospitals during a 2-y period. Forty-three individuals who were comatose (with pH < 7.25 and P aCO2 > 100 mm Hg at admission) were compared with 43 subjects who were not comatose and who were treated with NIV for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. NIV was applied by using the same protocol in both groups. They all had a do-not-intubate order and were considered vulnerable individuals with end-stage chronic respiratory failure according to well-validated scores. RESULTS: NIV yielded similar outcomes in the 2 groups regarding in-hospital mortality (n = 12 [28%] vs n = 12 [28%] in the noncomatose controls, P > .99) and 6-month survival (n = 28 [65%] vs n = 22 [51%] in the noncomatose controls, P = .31). Despite poor quality of life scores (21.5 +/- 10 vs 31 +/- 6 in the awakened controls, P = .056) as assessed by using the VQ11 questionnaire 6 months to 1 y after hospital discharge, a large majority of the survivors (n = 23 [85%]) would be willing to receive NIV again if a new episode of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure occurs. CONCLUSION: In the frailest subjects with supposed end-stage chronic respiratory failure that justifies treatment limitation decisions, it is worth trying NIV when acute hypercapnic respiratory failure occurs, even in the case of extreme respiratory acidosis with hypercapnic coma at admission.

Title: Congenital disorders of autophagy: an emerging novel class of inborn errors of neuro-metabolism.
Abstract: Single gene disorders of the autophagy pathway are an emerging, novel and diverse group of multisystem diseases in children. Clinically, these disorders prominently affect the central nervous system at various stages of development, leading to brain malformations, developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, movement disorders, and neurodegeneration, among others. Frequent early and severe involvement of the central nervous system puts the paediatric neurologist, neurogeneticist, and neurometabolic specialist at the forefront of recognizing and treating these rare conditions. On a molecular level, mutations in key autophagy genes map to different stages of this highly conserved pathway and thus lead to impairment in isolation membrane (or phagophore) and autophagosome formation, maturation, or autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Here we discuss 'congenital disorders of autophagy' as an emerging subclass of inborn errors of metabolism by using the examples of six recently identified monogenic diseases: EPG5-related Vici syndrome, beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration due to mutations in WDR45, SNX14-associated autosomal-recessive cerebellar ataxia and intellectual disability syndrome, and three forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia, SPG11, SPG15 and SPG49 caused by SPG11, ZFYVE26 and TECPR2 mutations, respectively. We also highlight associations between defective autophagy and other inborn errors of metabolism such as lysosomal storage diseases and neurodevelopmental diseases associated with the mTOR pathway, which may be included in the wider spectrum of autophagy-related diseases from a pathobiological point of view. By exploring these emerging themes in disease pathogenesis and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, we discuss how congenital disorders of autophagy inform our understanding of the importance of this fascinating cellular pathway for central nervous system biology and disease. Finally, we review the concept of modulating autophagy as a therapeutic target and argue that congenital disorders of autophagy provide a unique genetic perspective on the possibilities and challenges of pathway-specific drug development.

Title: Genetic and phenotypic characterization of complex hereditary spastic paraplegia.
Abstract: The hereditary spastic paraplegias are a heterogeneous group of degenerative disorders that are clinically classified as either pure with predominant lower limb spasticity, or complex where spastic paraplegia is complicated with additional neurological features, and are inherited in autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked patterns. Genetic defects have been identified in over 40 different genes, with more than 70 loci in total. Complex recessive spastic paraplegias have in the past been frequently associated with mutations in SPG11 (spatacsin), ZFYVE26/SPG15, SPG7 (paraplegin) and a handful of other rare genes, but many cases remain genetically undefined. The overlap with other neurodegenerative disorders has been implied in a small number of reports, but not in larger disease series. This deficiency has been largely due to the lack of suitable high throughput techniques to investigate the genetic basis of disease, but the recent availability of next generation sequencing can facilitate the identification of disease-causing mutations even in extremely heterogeneous disorders. We investigated a series of 97 index cases with complex spastic paraplegia referred to a tertiary referral neurology centre in London for diagnosis or management. The mean age of onset was 16 years (range 3 to 39). The SPG11 gene was first analysed, revealing homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in 30/97 (30.9%) of probands, the largest SPG11 series reported to date, and by far the most common cause of complex spastic paraplegia in the UK, with severe and progressive clinical features and other neurological manifestations, linked with magnetic resonance imaging defects. Given the high frequency of SPG11 mutations, we studied the autophagic response to starvation in eight affected SPG11 cases and control fibroblast cell lines, but in our restricted study we did not observe correlations between disease status and autophagic or lysosomal markers. In the remaining cases, next generation sequencing was carried out revealing variants in a number of other known complex spastic paraplegia genes, including five in SPG7 (5/97), four in FA2H (also known as SPG35) (4/97) and two in ZFYVE26/SPG15 Variants were identified in genes usually associated with pure spastic paraplegia and also in the Parkinson's disease-associated gene ATP13A2, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis gene TPP1 and the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy DNMT1 gene, highlighting the genetic heterogeneity of spastic paraplegia. No plausible genetic cause was identified in 51% of probands, likely indicating the existence of as yet unidentified genes.

Title: Whole genome sequencing reveals novel mutations causing autosomal dominant inherited macular degeneration.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common sight threatening condition. However, there are a number of monogenic macular dystrophies that are clinically similar to AMD, which can potentially provide pathogenetic insights. METHODS: Three siblings from a non-consanguineous Greek-Cypriot family reported central visual disturbance and nyctalopia. The patients had full ophthalmic examinations and color fundus photography, spectral-domain ocular coherence tomography and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. Targeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed as a first step to attempt to identify suspected mutations in C1QTNF5 and TIMP3 followed by whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: The three patients were noted to have symptoms of nyctalopia, early paracentral visual field loss and, in older patients, central vision loss. Imaging identified pseudodrusen, retinal atrophy and RPE-Bruch's membrane separation. Whole genome sequencing of the proband revealed two novel heterozygous variants in C1QTNF5, c.556C>T, and c.569C>G. The mutation segregated with disease in this family, occurred in cis, and resulted in missense amino acid changes P186S and S190W in C1QTNF5. In silico modeling of the variants revealed that the S190W mutations was likely to have the greatest pathologic effect and that the combination of the mutations was likely to have an additive effect. CONCLUSIONS: The novel mutations in C1QTNF5 identified here expand the genotypic spectrum of mutations causing late-onset retinal dystrophy.

Title: Maternal immune activation alters brain microRNA expression in mouse offspring.
Abstract: Objective: Maternal immune activation (MIA) is associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. Herein, we investigate the altered expression of microRNAs (miRNA), and that of their target genes, in the brains of MIA mouse offspring. Methods: To generate MIA model mice, pregnant mice were injected with polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid on embryonic day 12.5. We performed miRNA microarray and mRNA sequencing in order to determine the differential expression of miRNA and mRNA between MIA mice and controls, at 3 weeks of age. We further identified predicted target genes of dysregulated miRNAs, and miRNA-target interactions, based on the inverse correlation of their expression levels. Results: Mice prenatally subjected to MIA exhibited behavioral abnormalities typical of ASD, such as a lack of preference for social novelty and reduced prepulse inhibition. We found 29 differentially expressed miRNAs (8 upregulated and 21 downregulated) and 758 differentially expressed mRNAs (542 upregulated and 216 downregulated) in MIA offspring compared to controls. Based on expression levels of the predicted target genes, 18 downregulated miRNAs (340 target genes) and three upregulated miRNAs (60 target genes) were found to be significantly enriched among the differentially expressed genes. miRNA and target gene interactions were most significant between mmu-miR-466i-3p and Hfm1 (ATP-dependent DNA helicase homolog), and between mmu-miR-877-3p and Aqp6 (aquaporin 6). Interpretation: Our results provide novel information regarding miRNA expression changes and their putative targets in the early postnatal period of brain development. Further studies will be needed to evaluate potential pathogenic roles of the dysregulated miRNAs.

Title: Congenital lactic acidosis, cerebral cysts and pulmonary hypertension in an infant with FOXRED1 related complex I deficiency.
Abstract: Mitochondrial complex I is encoded by 38 nuclear-encoded and 7 mitochondrial-encoded genes. FOXRED1 is one of the 13 additional nuclear genes known as assembly factors. So far, four patients have been described with complex I deficiency caused by autosomal recessive mutations in FOXRED1. Here, we report the fifth patient with FOXRED1 related complex 1 deficiency presenting with prenatal onset of bilateral periventricular cysts, congenital lactic acidosis, and persistent life-limiting pulmonary hypertension. Whole exome sequencing identified a compound heterozygosity for a known pathogenic variant (c.612_615dupAGTG; p.A206SfsX15) (paternal) and a likely pathogenic variant (c.874G>A; p.Gly292Arg) (maternal). Deficiency of complex I was demonstrated by the absence of complex I on Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis and by a significantly reduced complex I enzyme activity in the patient's fibroblasts. Compared with the previous known FOXRED1 cases, unique clinical features observed in our patient include bilateral periventricular cysts and severe pulmonary hypertension. Whole exome sequencing was instrumental in recognizing the underlying gene defect in this patient.

Title: Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction in a child with Treacher Collins syndrome.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) mainly presents with severe craniofacial developmental abnormalities characterized by a combination of bilateral downward-slanting palpebral fissures, colobomas of the lower eyelids, hypoplasia of the facial bones, cleft palate, malformation of the external ears, atresia of the external auditory canals, and bilateral conductive hearing loss. It is due to mutations in Treacher Collins syndrome 1 (TCOF1) (5q32-q33.1) and Polymerase RNA 1 polypeptides D and C (POLR1D [13q12.2], and POLR1C [6p21.1]) genes, which are responsible for increased neuroepithelial apoptosis during embryogenesis resulting in the lack of neural crest cells involved in facial bone and cartilage formation. Altered function of the upper digestive tract has been reported, whereas severe dysmotility disorders have never been reported. We describe here the first case of TCS associated with histologically proven chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) in humans. Case presentatios A 12-year-old boy with TCS due to TCOF1 gene deletion experienced nutritional difficulties and digestive intolerance from birth. CIPO was suspected during childhood because of severe intestinal dysmotility leading to enteral-jejunal nutrition intolerance and dependence on total parenteral nutrition. Diagnosis of CIPO with nervous abnormalities was histologically confirmed on a surgical rectal biopsy that showed enlarged ganglionic myenteric plexus. At the age of 9 years, an isolated colonic stenosis without dilatation responsible for severe abdominal pain and altered quality of life led to digestive derivation contributing to rapid disappearance of chronic abdominal pain. At the age of 12 years, the patient was still dependent on total home parenteral nutrition 7 days a week to maintain regular growth velocity. CONCLUSION: Recently, mice studies have pointed out the role played by TCOF1 in ganglionic cell migration in the foregut, suggesting that the synergistic haploinsufficiency of Tcof1 and Pax3, a transcription factor regulating the RET gene involved in disorders of neural crest cell development, probably results in colonic aganglionosis and may explain the association described here between TCS and CIPO. This case may correspond to this possible mechanism in humans. These findings and our clinical report suggest that CIPO may be assessed as unusual digestive manifestations in TCS with TCOF1 deletion.

Title: Treacher Collins Syndrome
Abstract: CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is characterized by bilateral and symmetric downslanting palpebral fissures, malar hypoplasia, micrognathia, and external ear abnormalities. Hypoplasia of the zygomatic bones and mandible can cause significant feeding and respiratory difficulties. About 40%-50% of individuals have conductive hearing loss attributed most commonly to malformation of the ossicles and hypoplasia of the middle ear cavities. Inner ear structures tend to be normal. Other, less common abnormalities include cleft palate and unilateral or bilateral choanal stenosis or atresia. Typically intellect is normal. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of TCS is established in about 96% of probands by detection of a heterozygous (autosomal dominant) pathogenic variant in TCOF1 or POLR1D or biallelic (autosomal recessive) pathogenic variants in POLR1C or POLR1D using molecular genetic testing and in about 4% of probands by clinical findings when molecular genetic testing has not been performed or does not identify pathogenic variants in one of the known genes. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment should be tailored to the specific needs of each individual, preferably by a multidisciplinary craniofacial management team. Neonates with airway issues may require special positioning or tracheostomy to facilitate ventilation. Hearing loss is treated with bone conduction amplification, speech therapy, and educational intervention. Craniofacial reconstruction is often necessary. Cleft palate repair (if needed) occurs at about age one year; zygomatic and orbital reconstruction at about age five to seven years; and bilateral microtia and/or narrow ear canal reconstruction after age six years. The age of maxillomandibular reconstruction varies by severity; orthognathic therapies are typically before age 16 years. GENETIC COUNSELING: Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. Autosomal dominant TCS. About 54%-60% of probands have the disorder as the result of a de novo TCOF1 or POLR1D pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with TCS has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Autosomal recessive TCS. The parents of a child with autosomal recessive TCS are obligate heterozygotes (i.e., carriers of one POLR1C or POLR1D pathogenic variant). At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the TCS-related pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.

Title: The genetic landscape of Parkinson's disease.
Abstract: The cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unknown in most patients. Since 1997, with the first genetic mutation known to cause PD described in SNCA gene, many other genes with Mendelian inheritance have been identified. We summarize genetic, clinical and neuropathological findings related to the 27 genes reported in the literature since 1997, associated either with autosomal dominant (AD): LRRK2, SNCA, VPS35, GCH1, ATXN2, DNAJC13, TMEM230, GIGYF2, HTRA2, RIC3, EIF4G1, UCHL1, CHCHD2, and GBA; or autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance: PRKN, PINK1, DJ1, ATP13A2, PLA2G6, FBXO7, DNAJC6, SYNJ1, SPG11, VPS13C, PODXL, and PTRHD1; or an X-linked transmission: RAB39B. Clinical and neuropathological variability among genes is great. LRRK2 mutation carriers present a phenotype similar to those with idiopathic PD whereas, depending on the SNCA mutations, the phenotype ranges from early onset typical PD to dementia with Lewy bodies, including many other atypical forms. DNAJC6 nonsense mutations lead to a very severe phenotype whereas DNAJC6 missense mutations cause a more typical form. PRKN, PINK1 and DJ1 cases present with typical early onset PD with slow progression, whereas other AR genes present severe atypical Parkinsonism. RAB39B is responsible for a typical phenotype in women and a variable phenotype in men. GBA is a major PD risk factor often associated with dementia. A growing number of reported genes described as causal genes (DNAJC13, TMEM230, GIGYF2, HTRA2, RIC3, EIF4G1, UCHL1, and CHCHD2) are still awaiting replication or indeed have not been replicated, thus raising questions as to their pathogenicity. Phenotypic data collection and next generation sequencing of large numbers of cases and controls are needed to differentiate pathogenic dominant mutations with incomplete penetrance from rare, non-pathogenic variants. Although known genes cause a minority of PD cases, their identification will lead to a better understanding their pathological mechanisms, and may contribute to patient care, genetic counselling, prognosis determination and finding new therapeutic targets.

Title: Human SPG11 cerebral organoids reveal cortical neurogenesis impairment.
Abstract: SPG11 linked hereditary spastic paraplegia is a complex monogenic neurodegenerative disease that in addition to spastic paraplegia is characterized by childhood onset cognitive impairment, thin corpus callosum and enlarged ventricles. We have previously shown impaired proliferation of SPG11 neural progenitor cells (NPCs). For delineation of potential defect in SPG11 brain development we employ 2D culture systems and 3D human brain organoids derived from SPG11 patients' iPSC and controls. We reveal that an increased rate of asymmetric divisions of neural progenitor cells leads to proliferation defect, causing premature neurogenesis. Correspondingly, SPG11 organoids appeared smaller than controls and had larger ventricles as well as thinner germinal wall. Premature neurogenesis and organoid size were rescued by GSK3-inhibititors including the FDA-approved tideglusib. These findings shed light on the neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying disease pathology.

Title: CHST14/D4ST1 deficiency: New form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
Abstract: Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 14/dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (CHST14/D4ST1) deficiency represents a specific form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) caused by recessive loss-of-function mutations in CHST14. The disorder has been independently termed "adducted thumb-clubfoot syndrome", "EDS, Kosho type", and "EDS, musculocontractural type". To date, 31 affected patients from 21 families have been described. Clinically, CHST14/D4ST1 deficiency is characterized by multiple congenital malformations (craniofacial features including large fontanelle, hypertelorism, short and downslanting palpebral fissures, blue sclerae, short nose with hypoplastic columella, low-set and rotated ears, high palate, long philtrum, thin upper lip vermilion, small mouth, and micro-retrognathia; multiple congenital contractures including adduction-flexion contractures and talipes equinovarus as well as other visceral or ophthalmological malformations) and progressive multisystem fragility-related complications (skin hyperextensibility, bruisability, and fragility with atrophic scars; recurrent dislocations; progressive talipes or spinal deformities; pneumothorax or pneumohemothorax; large subcutaneous hematomas; and diverticular perforation). Etiologically, multisystem fragility is presumably caused by impaired assembly of collagen fibrils resulting from loss of dermatan sulfate (DS) in the decorin glycosaminoglycan side chain that promotes electrostatic binding between collagen fibrils. This is the first reported human disorder that specifically affects biosynthesis of DS. Its clinical characteristics indicate that CHST14/D4ST1 and, more fundamentally, DS, play a critical role in fetal development and maintenance of connective tissues in multiple organs. Considering that patients with CHST14/D4ST1 deficiency develop progressive multisystem fragility-related manifestations, establishment of a comprehensive and detailed natural history and health-care guidelines as well as further elucidation of the pathophysiology in view of future etiology-based therapy are crucial.

Title: CHST14/D4ST1 deficiency: New form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
Abstract: Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 14/dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (CHST14/D4ST1) deficiency represents a specific form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) caused by recessive loss-of-function mutations in CHST14. The disorder has been independently termed "adducted thumb-clubfoot syndrome", "EDS, Kosho type", and "EDS, musculocontractural type". To date, 31 affected patients from 21 families have been described. Clinically, CHST14/D4ST1 deficiency is characterized by multiple congenital malformations (craniofacial features including large fontanelle, hypertelorism, short and downslanting palpebral fissures, blue sclerae, short nose with hypoplastic columella, low-set and rotated ears, high palate, long philtrum, thin upper lip vermilion, small mouth, and micro-retrognathia; multiple congenital contractures including adduction-flexion contractures and talipes equinovarus as well as other visceral or ophthalmological malformations) and progressive multisystem fragility-related complications (skin hyperextensibility, bruisability, and fragility with atrophic scars; recurrent dislocations; progressive talipes or spinal deformities; pneumothorax or pneumohemothorax; large subcutaneous hematomas; and diverticular perforation). Etiologically, multisystem fragility is presumably caused by impaired assembly of collagen fibrils resulting from loss of dermatan sulfate (DS) in the decorin glycosaminoglycan side chain that promotes electrostatic binding between collagen fibrils. This is the first reported human disorder that specifically affects biosynthesis of DS. Its clinical characteristics indicate that CHST14/D4ST1 and, more fundamentally, DS, play a critical role in fetal development and maintenance of connective tissues in multiple organs. Considering that patients with CHST14/D4ST1 deficiency develop progressive multisystem fragility-related manifestations, establishment of a comprehensive and detailed natural history and health-care guidelines as well as further elucidation of the pathophysiology in view of future etiology-based therapy are crucial.
